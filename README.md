# C_seed_finder

## Overview

**C_seed_finder** is a project designed to help users find or predict seeds used in C-based random number generation, commonly applied in games or simulations like Keno. The tool analyzes patterns, generates or brute-forces possible seeds, and provides output that can be used for further prediction or validation.

## How It Works

- **Seed Searching**: The core logic brute-forces or intelligently narrows down possible seeds based on observed outputs from the random number generator.
- **Input Data**: Users provide observed outputs (e.g., game results, RNG values) through command-line arguments or input files.
- **Algorithm**: The tool implements mathematical or heuristic approaches to reverse-engineer the seed. Common techniques include:
  - Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) state stepping
  - Output matching against known or suspected seed ranges
  - Multithreading for faster brute-forcing (if supported by the codebase)
- **Output**: Possible seeds are printed to console or written to a file, along with confidence scores or matching details.

## Usage

### 1. Build Instructions

```bash
gcc -o c_seed_finder main.c
```

Or, if your codebase uses multiple C files:

```bash
gcc -o c_seed_finder *.c
```

### 2. Running the Program

```bash
./c_seed_finder [options] <input_data>
```

- **Options**: (Customize according to your code’s actual options)
  - `-i <input_file>`: Specify an input file containing observed outputs
  - `-r <range>`: Set the seed search range
  - `-t <threads>`: Number of threads for parallel search

### 3. Example

```bash
./c_seed_finder -i results.txt -r 0:1000000 -t 4
```

This command searches for seeds in the range 0 to 1,000,000 using 4 threads, with observed outputs provided in `results.txt`.

## Modification Guide

- **Core Logic**: Look for functions handling seed generation and matching, typically in files like `main.c`, `seed_finder.c`, etc.
- **Parameters**: You can adjust search ranges, matching algorithms, or input handling by modifying parsing logic and algorithm functions.
- **Adding Features**: To support new RNG types, implement additional generators and matching functions, and extend input parsing to accept configuration.
- **Performance**: Optimize by adding multithreading or SIMD instructions in performance-critical loops. Use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks.
